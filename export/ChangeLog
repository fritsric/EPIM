	* /: added existing project sources

	* libs/LIBRARIES: list of libraries required to run
	IndependentModeler application

	* ChangeLog: added this ChangeLog file, please follow started
	ChangeLog format (for another example how to write ChangeLog files
	visit Wikipedia)

	* IndependentModeler/IndependentModeler.ipr: fixed missing
	'?*.xsd' resource pattern (*.xsd files couldn't be loaded, which
	caused plugins.xml not to be read - as a result plugins couldn't
	be loaded)
