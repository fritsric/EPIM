 * ActionService interface is a base point for ProModAction handling. One is supposed to use methods defined in this
 * interface for registering and obtaining actions.
 *
 * Using ModelerSession.getActionService() is possible to get proper implementation of this interface ready for use.
 *
 * All instances of ProModAction class (this class is defined as abstract, so all class that extend ProMod class and
 * implement method actionPerformed(ActionEvent event)) are initially defined as disabled. This forces user to use this
 * mechanism for action registration. But on the other hand, this is not very strong protection, so be careful with
